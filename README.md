# Zimpler code test

## Candystore Exercise
Top customers and their favourites
Below this introduction, there is a list of customers of a candy store

Your goal is to extract the top customers, and their favourite snacks.

We might change the content of the [list of candy below](https://candystore.zimpler.net/#candystore-customers), so your program will need to fetch the data from this page somehow.

## Start the project
The project was done with Golang, so be sure to have Golang installed.
To start it, run the code below in the root folder of the project:
```shell
go run cmd/main.go
```
